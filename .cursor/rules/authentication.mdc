# Authentication Logic

Authentication is handled in [src/lib/auth.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth.ts), which configures NextAuth.js with both Azure AD and credentials providers. The authentication logic includes:
- Azure AD integration (settings are loaded from the database)
- Credentials-based login (email and password)
- Role-based session and JWT callbacks
- Audit logging for login events

The authentication UI and routes are located in [src/app/(auth)/](mdc:src/app/(auth)/) and [src/app/login/](mdc:src/app/login/).
