# Components Guide

Reusable React components are located in [src/components/](mdc:src/components/). This directory includes UI elements, dialogs, modals, and layout components used throughout the app.

For example, the sidebar navigation is implemented in [src/components/Sidebar.tsx](mdc:src/components/Sidebar.tsx), which provides the main navigation and user controls.

UI primitives and shared elements are further organized under [src/components/ui/](mdc:src/components/ui/).
